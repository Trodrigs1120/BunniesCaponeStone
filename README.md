# Grecipe

  About..

Grecipe is an all-in-one grocerystore/cookbook that allows users to buy everyday foods while at the same time providing recipes tailored to the food you just bought. The food selections can be filtered in respect to certain dietary restrictions, and the recipes generated will intelligently generate based on the food item's intended shelf life (based on a 1-2 week timeframe). Users can edit the items in their current inventory based on whether the item has expired or has been eaten, and will update the recipe list accordingly.
